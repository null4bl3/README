## Isaksen Design - 2016 / 2017
The business model of the movers and shakers of the fashion industry is structured in a way that many companies in the industry feel that many of the available tools for product handling and management simply does not work for them. What i could offer was a unique and specially tailored web application that handled full product management, orders and economics and inventory control. 

The system would become the very core of the company and phase out the fragmented and outdated tools like Excel and manual inventory, offering workflow automation in every area possible and tying everything from retail orders, industry convention sales and their economics system together. The project scope and size was fairly large, considering i took on the project as the only developer, but in just under 7 months i was able to hand over a VPS instance containing a core system with three different access portals divided into access points for employees, agents and retailers. 

The system contained everything from system wide SMTP mail server, on-boot automation, internal communications system across offices, stores, remote agents, warehouses and workshop, notification, logging and analysis of agent and retailer activity, prototype and production management with full front to back data structure, live dynamic PDF creation, real time dynamic stock inventory management, and all accounting data synced with third party eConomics system.
